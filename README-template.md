## :scroll: Description
A puppy adoption app build with Jetpack Compose and Navigation Component. App consists of two screens **Home** and **Detail** screens. This app also supports dark theme with a dedicated **Theme switch button** in Home to switch theme.


## :bulb: Motivation and Context
- This project is created for participation in **Compose Dev Challenge** which demonstrates the capability of Jetpack Compose in its beta state.
- While working on this project, I felt like using some future tools to create Android UI (I know declarative UI exists years before but it's something else when you really use in Native code).
